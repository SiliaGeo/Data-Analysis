Hospital Data Analysis 2022

Evaluating and monitoring the performance of hospitals is crucial for both the quality of healthcare services and the economy of the country. An efficient and reliable way to assess healthcare systems is through key performance indicators (KPIs). By leveraging these indicators, gaps in the quality or efficiency of hospitals can be identified, enabling an evaluation of their performance. The main objective of this study is the computation and analysis of financial and operational indicators in hospitals across all healthcare regions of Greece. Through this analysis, conclusions will be drawn regarding the smooth functioning or potential issues within these healthcare institutions.

Patient Charges Analysis || EDA and Clustering

Every dataset contains a narrative waiting to be uncovered. Behind each row and column lies a story of real-world phenomena, events, and interactions. Data mining, the process of extracting patterns and insights from large datasets, allows us to reveal these hidden stories. This involves applying various techniques and algorithms to discover valuable information for decision-making, prediction, and optimization. In this project, we delve into the factors influencing patient charges and explore potential correlations among these factors. By formulating hypotheses and conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Clustering, we aim to uncover hidden patterns and trends in the dataset.

Data Information

The dataset utilized in this project contains information about 1338 patients, represented by 1338 rows and 7 columns. The columns include:

    Age: Age of the primary beneficiary.
    Sex: Gender of the insurance contractor (female, male).
    BMI (Body Mass Index): An index providing insight into body weight relative to height, calculated as the ratio of weight to height squared (kg / m^2). Ideally, it falls between 18.5 to 24.9.
    Children: Number of children covered by health insurance or number of dependents.
    Smoker: Indicates whether the patient is a smoker or not.
    Region: The beneficiaryâ€™s residential area in the US, categorized as North-East, South-East, South-West, and North-West.
    Charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance.

Project Focus

    Hypothesis Formulation: Formulating hypotheses about how different factors (age, gender, BMI, etc.) might influence patient charges.
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducting EDA to analyze the distribution of variables, identify outliers, and gain insights into the relationships between variables.
    Clustering Analysis: Applying K-means clustering to group patients based on common characteristics and explore if certain clusters exhibit distinct charge patterns.
